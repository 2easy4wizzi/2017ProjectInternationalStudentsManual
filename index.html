					<h4>Shutdown</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Sunday to Thursday: regular business day. Everything
							opens on this days.
							<ul>
								<li>Regual public transportation gradually stop around
									9-10pm.</li>
								<li>Luckily on Haifa we have night lines - not the fastest
									lines, but very useful.<br> They start around 10:30pm and
									ends at 4am.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Friday: short day.
							<ul>
								<li>Businesses gradually shuts down. Around 3pm, most
									places are closed.</li>
								<li>Pubs, clubs and restaurants are opening around 9-10pm.</li>
								<li>Thank god, we have night lines also on Friday evening-
									line number 200.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Saturday: Israels day off.
							<ul>
								<li>Most stuff are closed during the day and reopens on
									Shabatt end around 7-8pm. Some, not all, of the public
									transportation resumes for 4-5 hours</li>
								<li>During the day we have 1 bus line that goes from the
									dorms each hour- line number 37</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>National holidays
							<ul>
								<li>The holiday evening is like Friday.</li>
								<li>The following day is like Saturday.</li>
								<li>Notice that some Holidays differs in their behavior.</li>

					<h4>Flight tickets</h4>
					<p>Careful while booking your flights. In Israel, public
						transportation's availability varies on weekends and on holidays.
						You should avoid coming or leaving on Friday and Saturday. Also,
						make sure there is no holiday on this date. Otherwise, you will be
						stuck with no cheap way to come from the airport to Haifa's
						dorms(see 'shutdown' chapter above). And if you did come here and
						there is no public transportation, there is a service called
						'Moniyot Sherut'. It's basically a taxi of 10 people that waits
						near the airport and will drive to Haifa for the price of around
						120 nis only when it fills up(could take a while). To be honest,
						it's quite nice because it will take you directly to the dorms
						without needing to change from the train to the bus. The downsides
						are that it will distribute all the passengers before you(we are
						kinda the last stop), and also there is no guarantee there will be
						a Sherut taxi waiting.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h4>After landing</h4>
					If you reached on a 'regular day'(Sunday-Thursday, not a holiday
					and between 7:00 to 17:00) this is the fastest route:
					<ul>
						<li>Go to the train(there is a train terminal right on the
							entrance).</li>
						<li>Destanation: "Hof ha'Carmel central station" - 1:15 hours
							drive</li>
						<li>Walk out from the train station and go to the central bus
							station(very short walk)</li>
						<li>Take Bus 146 - 30 minutes drive</li>
						<li>Go down on "University/Multi-Purpose" station</li>
						<li>The dorms are behind the station</li>
					</ul>
					You should always check Google maps. Click on the link below:<br>

				<h4>Public transportation</h4>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h4>Rav-Kav</h4>
					<p>In Israel we use "Rav-Kav", a card that you can charge with
						money and use it on the buses and trains. It is very recommended
						to get one on each of the central bus stations. It allows free
						reuse in the time frame of 90 mins. In order to get a 33%
						discount, first get a paper that states you are a student (ask the
						Int' school to give you) and then take that with you to a central
						bus station to get your Rav-Kav card.</p>
					<img src="resources/rav-kav.PNG" alt="rav-kavx.PNG"
						style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;">
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h4>Buses</h4>
					<a href="http://www.egged.co.il/HomePage.aspx">Egged Israel
						Transport</a>
					<p>HEADS UP: Each bus has a Number and final destination
						written on it. A common mistake is to get on a bus just because of
						it's number. Some lines, like 146, go by the university but in
						both directions! This happens because both buses diverge from
						their route to go by the university, pick up passengers, and go
						back to their route. If you are not sure, ask the driver if he
						reaches your destination.</p>
					<p>The bus rides' fees depend on areas. In Haifa, you can get
						on the bus without stating your destination, It's the same price,
						around 6 shekels. If you go from Haifa to a city near by, tell the
						driver and he will charge you accordingly.</p>
					<p>The closest station to the dorms is
						"University/Multi-Purpose" and NOT "University/Eshkol Tower". See
						campus map</p>
					<div>
						Key buses:
						<ul>
							<li>37- starts/finish at "University/Multi-Purpose"(works
								also on Saturday) - Horev center, Merkaz Carmel, Down town</li>
							<li>24- starts/finish at "University/Multi-Purpose" - Horev
								center, Down town, Hof ha'Carmel central station (careful, to
								Hof ha'Carmel take bus 146. bus 24 takes much more time).</li>
							<li>146- starts at Merkazit HaMifrats central station to Hof
								ha'Carmel central station - Horev center, Haifa mall, Hof
								ha'Carmel station, Beach</li>
							<li>146- starts at Hof ha'Carmel central station to Merkazit
								HaMifrats central station - Cinamall - Lev HaMifrats mall</li>
							<li>137- starts/finish at "University/Multi-Purpose" - Grand
								Canyon mall</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h4>Trains</h4>
					<a href="https://www.rail.co.il/">Israel Railways</a>
					<p>The 2 closest train stations are Hof ha'Carmel central
						station and Merkazit HaMifrats central station. You can buy
						tickets using your Rav-Kav.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h4>Special taxis</h4>
					<p>A bit expensive but if you want/have to use special taxis, i
						would recommend to use 'Gett taxi'. Also, you should connect your
						credit card to the app so no 'funny' business would happen.</p>

				<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h4>Phone sim card</h4>
					<p>Try the Akademon store on the 600 floor in the main
						building. Last year (2017) "019" had a deal - buy a sim card and
						pay each month in advanced about 50 shekels and get unlimited
						calls and sms and something like 5GB. It's a good deal.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h4>Free Wifi on campus</h4>
					<p>On the dorms, each apartment has a modem inside of it(or a
						lan connection) and the price is included in your rent fee. The
						internet isn't the best but we can work with it</p>
					<p>Eduram network: good signal on campus (except on the dorms).
						I'm not sure if you get a Username, but if you do then you connect
						to it as so: Username is yourID@haifa.ac.il and the pass is to
						your campus account.</p>
					<p>Aircarmel network: ok signal on the dorms boardwalk and good
						on campus. Ask the International school to supply a password and
						user name</p>
					<p>On both Eduram and Aircarmel, you can ask a local student to
						connect with his Username and pass :)</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h4>Weather</h4>
					<p>One important thing to remember, the dorms are on top of
						Carmel mountain.</p>
					<p>
						<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coming on Summer
							time</span><br>Common mistake is to see the weather and say: "Wow,
						it's so hot. I don't need to take long clothes". True,it is hot.
						But on the nights most people like to have a light jacket with
						them. It gets windy sometimes. So you might want to pack 2 or 3
						light jackets (don't bring heavy coats).
					</p>
					<p>
						<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coming on Winter
							time</span><br>Just like the summer mistake, also here people see
						the weather and bring light winter clothes. In the winter, its
						really freezing in here. I recommend to bring at least some
						'heavy' winter clothes.

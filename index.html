				<h4>Before coming to Israel</h4>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h4>Flight tickets</h4>
					<p>Careful while booking your flights. In Israel, public
						transportation’s availability varies on weekends and on holidays
						(see public transportation chapter). You should avoid coming or
						leaving on Friday and Saturday. Also, make sure there is no
						holiday on this date. Otherwise, you will be stuck with no cheap
						way to come from the airport to Haifa's dorms</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h4>After landing</h4>
					<p>You should get on a train from Natbag(Ben Gurion airport) to
						"Hof ha'Carmel central station" and from there to Haifa
						University(the dorms are on the edge of the University). The drive
						should take around 2 hours (1:15 on the train).</p>

				<h4>Public transportation</h4>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h4>Rav-Kav</h4>
					<p>In Israel we use ”Rav-Kav”, a card that you can charge with
						money and use it on the buses and trains. It is very recommended
						to get one on each of the central bus stations. It allows free
						reuse in the time frame of 90 mins. In order to get a 33%
						discount, first get a paper that states you are a student (ask the
						Int' school to give you) and then take that with you to a central
						bus station to get your Rav-Kav card.</p>

				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h4>Buses</h4>
					<a href="http://www.egged.co.il/HomePage.aspx">Egged Israel
						Transport</a>
					<p>HEADS UP: Each bus has a Number and final destination
						written on it. A common mistake is to get on a bus just because of
						it's number. Some lines, like 146, go by the university but in
						both directions! This happens because both buses diverge from
						their route to go by the university, pick up passengers, and go
						back to their route. If you are not sure, ask the driver if he
						reaches your destination.</p>
					<p>The bus rides’ fees depend on areas. In Haifa, you can get
						on the bus without stating your destination, It's the same price,
						around 6 shekels. If you go from Haifa to a city near by, tell the
						driver and he will charge you accordingly.</p>
					<p>The closest station to the dorms is
						"University/Multi-Purpose" and NOT "University/Eshkol Tower". See
						campus map</p>
					<div>
						Key buses:
						<ul>
							<li>37- starts/finish at "University/Multi-Purpose"(works
								also on Saturday) - Horev center, Merkaz Carmel, Down town</li>
							<li>24- starts/finish at "University/Multi-Purpose" - Horev
								center, Down town, Hof ha'Carmel central station (careful, to
								Hof ha'Carmel take bus 146. bus 24 takes much more time).</li>
							<li>146- starts at Merkazit HaMifrats central station to Hof
								ha'Carmel central station - Horev center, Haifa mall, Hof
								ha'Carmel station, Beach</li>
							<li>146- starts at Hof ha'Carmel central station to Merkazit
								HaMifrats central station - Cinamall - Lev HaMifrats mall</li>
							<li>137- starts/finish at "University/Multi-Purpose" - Grand
								Canyon mall</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h4>Trains</h4>
					<a href="https://www.rail.co.il/">Israel Railways</a>
					<p>The 2 closest train stations are Hof ha'Carmel central
						station and Merkazit HaMifrats central station. You can buy
						tickets using your Rav-Kav.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h4>Applications</h4>
					<p>It's recommended to use "Moovit" or Google maps
						Applications. Most times, there is a live feed on when then bus
						will arrive</p>

				<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h4>Phone sim card</h4>
					<p>Try the Akademon store on the 600 floor in the main
						building. Last year (2017) "019" had a deal - buy a sim card and
						pay each month in advanced about 50 shekels and get unlimited
						calls and sms and something like 5GB. It's a good deal.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h4>Free Wifi on campus</h4>
					<p>On the dorms, each apartment has a modem inside of it(or a
						lan connection) and the price is included in your rent fee. The
						internet isn't the best but we can work with it</p>
					<p>Eduram network: good signal on campus (except on the dorms).
						I’m not sure if you get a Username, but if you do then you connect
						to it as so: Username is yourID@haifa.ac.il and the pass is to
						your campus account.</p>
					<p>Aircarmel network: ok signal on the dorms boardwalk and good
						on campus. Ask the International school to supply a password and
						user name</p>
					<p>On both Eduram and Aircarmel, you can ask a local student to
						connect with his Username and pass :)</p>
